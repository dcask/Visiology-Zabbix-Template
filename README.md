# Visiology-Zabbix-Template
Pre-official template for Zabbix server
The template uses zabbix/agent2 installed either in a container with a separate stack or directly on the server. To install it in a container just use zabbix.yml and specify the Visiology platform address and hostname. Active checks are used, so there is no need to open a port on the platform side. It is required to set the Zabbix user with API rights into {$ADMIN.USER}/{$ADMIN.PASSWORD}. Set the address of the Zabix server and the Visiology platform administrator in the corresponding macros. The hostname have to match the name in the agent2 settings. The {$LOG_LIST} macro contains a list of services for processing logs which can be extended to create new processing elements
